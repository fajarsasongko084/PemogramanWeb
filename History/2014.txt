The world premiere of the new HURACÁN LP 610-4 at the 2014 Geneva Auto Show opened a new era for Automobili Lamborghini and the entire segment of luxury super sports cars.

In 2015, the Huracán series was expanded with several new, unmissable models: the Spyder, engineered to fend the air and merge with the sky, and the RWD, conceived and produced with a view to turn a technological vehicle into the purest example of “driving fun.”
